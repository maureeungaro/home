## Single {{ site.pi0 }} electro-production at high {{ site.q2 }} in the Delta resonance region


We report the analysis of exclusive single {{ site.pi0 }} electro-production in the 
{{site.deltaM}} resonance region at Jefferson Lab in the {{ site.q2 }} 
range {{ site.rarr }} 6 {{ site.gev2 }}. 

{{ site.pi0 }} c.m. angular distributions are obtained over the entire 4{{site.pi}} 
c.m. solid angle. 
The c.m. differential cross section is measured.
The GM*, REM = E1+/ M1+ and RSM = S1+/ M1+ multipoles for the Î” 
resonance production are extracted using both a truncated multipoles analysis and
