## Single {{ site.pi0 }} electro-production at high {{ site.q2 }} in the Delta resonance region


We report the analysis of exclusive single {{ site.pi0 }} electro-production in the 
{{ site.deltaM }} resonance region at Jefferson Lab in the {{ site.q2 }} 
range {{ site.rarr }} 6 {{ site.gev2 }}. 

{{ site.pi0 }} c.m. angular distributions are obtained over the entire 4{{site.pi}} 
c.m. solid angle. 
The c.m. differential cross section is measured.
The {{ site.gms }} form factor and multipoles ratios {{ site.rem }} = {{ site.e1p }} / {{ site.m1p }} and {{ site.rsm }} = {{ site.s1p }} / {{ site.m1p }} 
 for the {{ site.deltaM }}
resonance production are extracted using both a truncated multipoles analysis and the JANR unitary isobar model.
