## [{{ site.pi0 }} electro-production at high {{ site.q2 }} in the first and second resonance region](pi0_resonance/pi0_resonance)

# Proton Identification

The candidate protons are all positive time-based tracks after the proton identification.
The cuts are based on the candidate's reconstructed momentum and its signals on the Time of Flight. 
The cuts are sector-dependent.
