The following trick is used to have a buttons group to select blog categories:


1. create the category file inside _blog_cats, make sure the title and permalinks are correct, for example:
```
title: gemc
permalink: /search/gemc
```


2. copy the buttons div, make sure to change the style with the selected button
3. copy the content div, make sure to change the if statement to match the category
4. add the displayless iframe in g_blog
